	<p class="bio"> 
		Gabe is a member of the Class of 2017, and is pursuing a major in Computer Science. He fell in love with programming his senior year in high school, and is just beginning to understand the true power and flexibility of computer science. He is a Teaching Assistant for the Introduction to Data Structures class and loves to help other people learn, discover, and appreciate the awesomeness that is programming.  Outside of the realm of programming and math, however, he also has many other academic interests. He is very inquisitive about child development, psychology, and behavioral analysis, and his curiosity led him to working with Americorps' Jumpstart program, where he spent a large portion of his first year at Tufts teaching young children literacy skills. This curiosity also lead him to his current job, where he works in the Evelyn G. Pitcher Curriculum Lab, managing the STEM curriculum matterials available to teachers of young children. He often wanders into guest lectures being presented around campus, hoping to learn more about a different area of study in which another human has devoted his/her life to.

		Born and raised in Colorado, he is an avid lover of hiking, rafting, and observing nature (he is know to get lost in his own thoughts gazing at a beautiful landscape). If you were to see him at Tufts, you might find him coding at a Hackathon, exploring the campus or the Boston area, helping prepare a talk for the annual Tufts Idea Exchange, hanging out with friends, getting lost while jogging, enjoying a good meal, taking the occasional ballroom dance lesson, or trying out something completely new.
